This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews from the Tinder app. By extracting reviews from Google Play Store using the google-play-scraper, and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we classify reviews into three categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive. The goal is to understand how users feel about the app and gain insights into their experiences based on sentiment.
